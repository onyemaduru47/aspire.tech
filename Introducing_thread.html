      <!-- <h2 class="post-sub-heading">Create Best UX Deign</h2> -->
      <p class="post-text">Meta has unveiled its long-awaited competitor to Twitter in what chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pitched as a “friendly” alternative to the struggling social media platform owned by Elon Musk. The app, called Threads, is a “text-based conversation app” where users can publish posts up to 500 characters long, and include links, photos, and videos. As with Twitter, the posts can be replied to, liked, or shared by others. </p>  
      
      <h2 class="post-sub-heading">What is Thread</h2>
      <p class="post-text">Threads is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. The app is intended to work adjacent to Instagram: users need to have an Instagram account to sign up and are required to use the same handle.[4] Widely viewed as a direct competitor to Twitter, Threads users are able to post text and images, reply to posts by others, or like posts. </p>
  
      <p class="post-text">Following its launch on Wednesday Zuckerberg used his own Threads account to say it had signed up 10mn users in the first seven hours. “Let’s do this. Welcome to Threads,” he wrote earlier in his first post. Threads is directly linked to Instagram, Meta’s popular photo-sharing platform with more than 2bn users and is being rolled out in more than 100 countries for iOS and Android, the company said. The launch of the app, dubbed the “Twitter killer” by some users, poses a direct threat to Musk’s platform. Since Twitter was bought by the billionaire for $44bn in October, it has lurched from crisis to crisis, frustrating users and big advertisers while teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>

      <p class="post-text">Mark Zuckerberg just announced the initial version of Threads, an app built by the Instagram team for sharing with text. Whether you’re a creator or a casual poster, Threads offers a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations. We are working toward making Threads compatible with the open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.</p>

      <p class="post-text">In a post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg cast Threads as a more wholesome substitute to Twitter. “The goal is to keep it friendly as it expands. I think it’s possible and will ultimately be the key to its success,” Zuckerberg wrote. “That’s one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently.” Meta has long grappled with concerns from academics and activists that it does not sufficiently police its Instagram and Facebook platforms, but over time it has tightened up its policies and invested in increased moderation. The rollout comes as Musk, by contrast, has relaxed Twitter’s approach to moderation, prompting dozens of advertisers to flee and reducing its $5bn annual revenues by 50 per cent. Some Twitter users have sought alternatives to the platform over Musk’s moderation stance and the introduction of an $8-a-month premium service with some features that had previously been free. Over the weekend Musk provoked frustration from some Twitter users when he introduced temporary limits on the number of posts users could view. He said it was an attempt to “address extreme levels of data scraping [and] system manipulation”.</p>
      
      <p class="post-text">Following the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, Meta employees discussed extending the rollout of Instagram Notes, a forthcoming text-based feature to Instagram. Employees also discussed a separate text-focused app. Development on Threads began in January 2023, then internally known as "Project 92". Information on Threads was released in March, and The Verge published details of an internal company-wide meeting in June. Details emerged about Threads in July, and Meta Platforms published the app to the Apple App Store on July 3 with a release date of July 6. Threads officially launched on July 5 in 100 countries, excluding the European Union. </p>
