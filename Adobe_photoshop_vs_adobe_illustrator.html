      <p class="post-text">Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are two widely acclaimed graphic image editing programs in the field of digital design, and both platforms are often used by photographers, designers, and artists alike.
        It can be very confusing to decide which of these two top-notch programs is ideal for you if you are new to the design industry. Don't worry, just keep reading. We'll go over the differences between Adobe Illustrator vs Photoshop as well as appropriate times to use each application. We are assured that you will shortly be in a position to choose the right one based on your needs.</p>  
      
        <h2 class="post-sub-heading">What is the Difference Between Photoshop and Illustrator?</h2>
      <p class="post-text">Although the two programs are similar in many ways, you can find many differences between them by closely examining each program and identifying its unique characteristics.</p>
      
      <p class="post-text"><b>Adobe Photoshop </b>is an excellent raster-based program for modifying images or graphics that have been created, such as photographs. It is known as the design industry standard for photo editing software and is also one of Adobe's most popular programs.
        Photoshop was originally developed for photographers, but over time, now, Photoshop is known for creating web designs, advertising images, videos, and editing images. Its wide range of features and editing tools have been recognized by almost all users. Photoshop is a raster-based image editing program. Images are made up of pixels, and to put it bluntly, Photoshop software uses millions of little squares of different colors to make up each image. So most intuitively, zoom in on an image in Photoshop and you will see how the image is made up of pixels one by one, especially around the edges.
        </p>

      <p class="post-text"><b>Adobe Illustrator</b> (also known as AI) is a vector graphics designing software, which is the biggest difference between it and Photoshop. It is also one of the most popular programs in the design and art industry.
        At the beginning of its early development in 1985, version 1.0 was codenamed Picaso and was mainly used to design logos, cartoons, illustrations, etc. Because vector drawings are more advantageous in this area. In addition, Illustrator is also better at text layout, and the design of brochures, sale posters, etc. Illustrator is a vector-based photo editing program. Vector graphics are compiled according to mathematical rules. In AI, a vector is not a line made of pixels, but is created by two points connected by a computer algorithm. Each line is also called a vector path, and together they form a vector object. It doesn't matter how much you zoom in on the image in AI, because you can't see the pixel squares, which means the image won't be blurry, its edges will always be smooth and sharp.
